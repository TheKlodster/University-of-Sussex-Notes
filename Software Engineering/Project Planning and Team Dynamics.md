# Project Planning and Team Dynamics
Planning a project **includes** :
- organisational information.
- a breakdown of the phases & tasks.
- a list of milestones for each phase, and
- a PERT chart.
- conflict of resolution protocol.
- peer assessment plan.

Planning helps you :
- know what to do next.
- track your progress.
- estimate how long and what resources are required.

Making a **good** plan :
- Software Scope.
- Resources.
- Experience.

Set up Milestones! Milestones show how the project is proceeding. It's good for morale and focus, but enables you to ask the question *'How are WE doing?'*.

### PERT Chart
--------------------------------------------------
**Critical Path** - a chain of tasks which must be completed on time if the project is to finish at the time predicted.
