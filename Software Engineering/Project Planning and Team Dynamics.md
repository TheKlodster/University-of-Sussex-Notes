*Lectures 3 & 4*
# Project Planning and Team Dynamics
Planning a project **includes** :
- organisational information.
- a breakdown of the phases & tasks.
- a list of milestones for each phase, and
- a PERT chart.
- conflict of resolution protocol.
- peer assessment plan.

Planning helps you :
- know what to do next.
- track your progress.
- estimate how long and what resources are required.

Making a **good** plan :
- Software Scope.
	1. what are the **inputs**/**outputs** of the system?
	1. are there any **performance constraints**?
	1. how **reliable** must the system be?
- Resources.
	1. how much **equipment** is there?
	1. what **staff** can be employed?
	1. is any **existing software** re-usable here?
- Experience.
	1. how long have **similar projects** taken?
	1. what about other systems of **similar size**?

Set up Milestones! Milestones show how the project is proceeding. It's good for morale and focus, but enables you to ask the question *'How are WE doing?'*.

### PERT Chart
--------------------------------------------------

**Critical Path** - a chain of tasks which must be completed on time if the project is to finish at the time predicted. <br>
	- a task is on a critical path when its earliest finish the same as its latest: no *slack*!
**Slack** - difference in the latest and earliest finish of each activity.

#### What does it do?
Provides useful information :
- Expected project completion time.
- Activity start/end dates.
- **Critical Path** activities that directly impact completion time.
- Activities that have slack time can lend resources to critical path activities

#### How?
1. Estimate **how long** each task will take.
1. Assign **dependencies**.
1. Assign **deadlines**.
1. Draw a **dependency network** for the tasks.
1. Calculate the **earlier possible finish** and **latest allowable finish** for each task.
1. Calculate the ***critical path***.

### Staff Organisation
--------------------------------------------------
Several factors:
1. Personalities.
1. Individual Skills and Weaknesses.
1. The nature of the project.

Issues:
1. *Accountability* - everyone should be accountable, no finger-pointing.
1. *Administrative Overhead* - some management structures require more administration than others.
1. *Morale* - work rate decreased if morale is low.

### Organisation Styles
--------------------------------------------------
Three distinct styles:
1. **Democratic Decentralised** - team works as a collection of peers with no leader.
	- Benefits : loose, informal style, which gives developers freedom. More communication paths, suitable for small, tough projects.
	- Costs : lack of top-level control implies schedules may slip.
1. **Controlled Decentralised** - defined leader, but problem solving is a group activity.
	- Benefits : encourages group work and creativity. Reliable software can be expected.
	- Costs : mildly more rigid (not as flexible).
1. **Controlled Centralised** - everything is managed by the leader. Essential communication between individuals and leader.
	- Benefits : great managerial control, therefore suitable for straightforward but large projects.
	- Costs : little communication overhead.

### Broad Objectives
--------------------------------------------------
1. **Open-Ended, Creativity** - coming up with a brand new concept or approach. **Autonomy** is the point to be emphasized.
1. **Problem Resolution** - attempting to resolve a *complex* and *ill-defined* problem. **Trust** between team members is of foremost importance.
1. **Tactical Execution** - a *concrete plan* is driven to conclusion to produce a new piece of software quickly with minimum fuss. **Clarity of thought and action** is the most important point.

### Successful Group Ethics
1. Trust/Honesty.
1. Mutual Respect/Courtesy.
1. Responsibility/Motivation/Commitment.
1. Inclusiveness/Recognition of Diversity.
#### Critical Paths
- A task is on a critical path precisely when its earliest finish is the same as its latest: no *slack*!
