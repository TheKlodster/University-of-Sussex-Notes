# User Research Methods

## Five Key issues
1. **Setting goals** - decide why you are gathering data.
2. **Identifying participants** - decide who to gather data from.
3. **Relationship with participants** - clear & professional, informed consent.
4. **Triangulation** - look at data from more than one perspective.
    - e.g. quantitative + qualitative data.
5. **Pilot studies** - small trial of main study.
