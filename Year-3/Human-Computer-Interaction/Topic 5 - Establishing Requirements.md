# Establishing Requirements

## What are the requirements?
Statements that specify:
- **what** an intended product should do.
- **how** it should perform.

Defining requirements is the stage where **failure** occurs most commonly. Getting correct requirements is **crucial**.
</center>

### How to establish requirements
1. Gather data.
2. Analyse data to produce findings.
3. Express findings as *requirements*.
   
This is an iterative process.

### What to gather
- **functional**: what the product should do.
- **non-functional**: how the product should work.
- **data requirements**: e.g. type, size, accuracy of the data.
- **user requirements**: characteristics of the intended user group.
- **usability requirements**: usability goals.
- **user experience requirements**: user experience goals.
- **design requirements**: what needs to change for a solution.

#### Environmental requirements
- **physical environment**: dusty, noisy, light, heat, vibration?
- **social environment**: sharing of files/displays across distances, privacy, working individually.
- **organisational environment**: hierarchy, user support, infrastructure, availability of training.
- **technical envrionment**: what technologies will the product run on, need to be compatible with.

## Design Requirements
### Step 1: Create problem & vision statements
- say what is the current problem.
- what needs to change.
- what will change as a result.

### Step 2: Explore & brainstorm
- focus on what the persona would want.
- design without prejudgement.
- be open-minded.
- set a limit(from a few hours to a couple days).

### Step 3: Identify persona expectations
For each persona, identify the following:
- what influences their expectations(e.g. attitudes)?
- what are their technology-related expectations?
- what are the expected behaviours from the technology?
- how they think about basic elements of data(e.g. messages and people in an email application).

### Step 4: Construct context scenarios
- tell the story of a particular user, i.e persona.
- present various motivations, needs and goals.
- describe high-level actions from the user's perspective.
- treat the prototype as a magic black box.

### Step 5: Identify design requirements
- what information and capabilities do our personas require to accomplish their goals?
- define the **what**(i.e goals) before the **how**(i.e how the prototype looks and behaves).
- format your design requirements as follows:
  - "call (*action*) a person (*object*) directly from an appointment (*context*).

## Use cases
- Origins in object-oriented design techniques.
- Detailed look at user-technology interaction.
- Use case associated with user goal.
- Use case describes "normal course", i.e. the expected interaction.
