*Assumption* - taking something for granted when it needs further investigation. <br>
*Claim* - stating something to be true when it is still open to question.

### Framework for analysing the **Problem Space**

Choice of model depends on what we know about:

- *user tasks*
  - task description, task analysis.
- *user goals*
  - scenario, use cases.
