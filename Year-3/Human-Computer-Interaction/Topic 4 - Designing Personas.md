# Designing Personas

## Personas
- User profiles which capture user characteristics.
- **Not real people**.
- Make them feel real with a name, characteristics, goals, personal background.
- Do not use stereotypes in your persona design.

### How are they designed?
- Model of the user.
- Look at the user from a higher abstraction level.
- Not a model of a general user.
- Design for specific user types & their needs.
- Analyse the behaviour patterns of target users.

### Demographics
- Account for the social background of the target user.
- Account for the ranges of their characteristics (e.g. age), but do not calculate the average.
- Assignment 1: 1 primary persona required, secondary is nice to have.

### Why are they useful?
- Determine what and how the prototype should do.
- Help the different stakeholders communicate.
- Easier to realte the prototype to the target user.
- Create empathy and motivate the design of good UX.
- Powerful reality-check tool.

### Design pitfalls
- Designing an "elasic persona" (a persona cannot accommodate all the possible target users).
- Self-reflection design (a persona is not you).
- Cool design =! good design.
- Getting stuck on edge cases (test such cases but do not focus on them).

### Motivation & Goals
People are bad at naming goals, hence we should extract goals from behvaiours.
- Observe the target users and specify their tasks as short sentences.
- Account for differences in motivations and goals.

Imagine designing a car that pleases for everyone - might produce a car that won't work for anyone.

## Conducting Personas
1. Group interviewees by role.
2. .
3. Map interviewees to behavioural variables.
4. Indentify significant behaviour patterns.
    - look for clusters of interviewees.
    - behaviour petterns will form the basis of a persona.
    - look for meaningful patterns.
5. Synthesise characteristics and define goals. Define the following:
    - the behaviour themselves.
    - the use environment(s).
    - frustrations.
    - demographics.
    - skills, experience or abilities.
    - attitudes and emotions.
    - relevant interations with other people.
    - alternate or competing ways of doing the same thing.
6. Check for completeness and redundancies.
7. Designate persona types.
    - primary (the main target).
    - secondary (may have additional needs).
    - supplemental (could be added due to political reasons).
    - customer (in the segment but not an end user).
    - served (doesn't use prototype but affected by it).
    - negative (someone you are not designing for).
8. Expand the description of attributes and behaviours.
