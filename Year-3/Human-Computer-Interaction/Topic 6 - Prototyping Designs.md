# Topic 6: Prototyping Designs

## What is a Prototype?
In interaction design, it can be:
- a series of screen sketches.
- a storyboard (e.g. a cartoon-like series of scenes).
- a slideshow (e.g. powerpoint).
- a video simulating the ue of a system.

## Fidelity
Fidelity = level of realism.

Start with a low-fidelity prototype &rarr; a mid-fidelity prototype &rarr; a high-fidelity prototype.

### Low-fi prototyping
Usually presented in a sketch or drawing, it is quick and cheap:
- sketches.
- storyboards.
- paper.

1. Brainstorm different representations.
2. Choose a representation.
3. Rough out interface style.
4. Test interaction style.

### Mid/Hi-fi prototyping
- look more like the final system.
- mid-fi prototypes can take the form of wireframes/schematics and have some simulated functionality.
- hi-fi prototypes include some working functionality and may be created in the final language.

Use prototyping to answer questions.
