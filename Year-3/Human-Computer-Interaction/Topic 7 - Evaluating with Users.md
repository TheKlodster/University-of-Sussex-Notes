# Evaluating with Users

## Usability Testing
- takes place in a controlled setting.
- focus on how well users perform tasks with the product.
- involves testing and recording typical user' performance on typical tasks.
- users are observed and timed.
- testers record time taken to complete task and number/type of errors.
- comparison of products or prototypes is common.

### Data Collection
Data gathered through video & interaction logging (e.g. key presses) to record:
- time to complete a task.
- time to complete a task after a specified time away from the product.
- number and type of errors per task.
- number of errors per unit of time.
- number of navigations to online help or manuals.
- number of users making a particular error.
- number of users completing task successfully.

Interviews and questionnaires can add to this data and help to explain errors or frustrations.

### Conditions
- emphasis on:
  - selecting representative users.
  - developing representative tasks.

- informed consent form explains procedures and deals with ethical issues.
- the test conditions should be the same for every participant.
- tasks usually last no more than 30 minutes.

### Participants
- pratical issue depending on:
  - schedule for testing.
  - availability of participants.
  - cost of running tests.

- 5-10 users typically selected.

### Pros & Cons

| **Pros**                                                                                                | **Cons**                                                       |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| - Uninterrupted - can access performance, identify errors and help explain why users did what they did. | - Controlled settings are artificial and lack context.         |
| - Can use in conjunction with satisfaction questionnaries and interviews to elicit user questions.      | - Requires skill to determine typical users and typical tasks. |
|                                                                                                         | - Requires (at least) 4 members of the design team.            |
|                                                                                                         | - Time to set up tests, recruit participants and run tests.    |
|                                                                                                         | - Need access to resources/equipment.                          |

## Experiments
- formulate and test hypothesis (typing is faster than swiping).
- predict the relationship between two or more variables (typing time, keyboard type).
- independent variable is manipulated by the researcher (keyboard type, language).
- dependent variable influenced by the independent variable (typing time).
- typical experimental designs have one or two independent variables.
- validated statistically & replicable.

### Experimental Designs
- **different participants**: single group of participants are allocated randomly to the experimental conditions.
- **same participants**: all participants take part in both conditions.
- **matched participants**: participants are matched in pairs, e.g. based on expertise, gender, etc...

| **Design**    | **Pros**                                                           | **Cons**                                               |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Different** | No order effects.                                                  | Many participants & individual differences, problem.   |
| **Same**      | Few individuals, no individual differences.                        | Counter-balancing needed because of ordering effects.  |
| **Matched**   | Same as different participants but individual differences reduced. | Cannot be sure of perfect matching on all differences. |
