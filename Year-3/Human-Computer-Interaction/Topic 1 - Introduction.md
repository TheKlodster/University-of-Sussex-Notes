Bad design often results from failing to consider:
- who the users are.
- what users want and need.
- what activities are being carried out.
- where and when the interaction is taking place.

## Design Principles
- **visibility**
    - functions that are visible make it easier for the user to do next.
- **feedback**
    - let users know: the status of the system; that an action has been performed successfully or not.
- **constrains**
    - restricts the kinds of user interactions that can take place.
- **mapping**
    - make sure the relationship between a control and its effect is clear.
- **consistency**
    - similar elements should have similar functions (or allow you to achieve similar tasks).
    - allows people to discover patterns that they can apply to new situations.
- **affordances**
    - visual attribute that gives the user an idea of how to interact with it.
