# Malware: Viruses & Worms

## Classification of Malware
Two broad categories:
- Propagation
- Payload

## Types of Malware
**Propagation** mechanisms include:
- viruses.
- worms.
- social engineering attacks:
  - pishing links.
  - fake emails.
  - harrassing calls.

**Payload** actions can include:
- corruption of system or data files.
- theft of service.
- theft of information.
- hiding its presence on the system.

## Attack Kits
The development and deployment of malware required considerable technical skill by software authors. Toolkits are often known as *crimeware*.

Attack kits include propagation & payload modules.

Examples:
- Zeus
- Angler

## Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)
Persistent application of intrusion technologies and malware to selected targets.
- Usually business or political.

These attacks differ from others due to their target selection and stealthy intrusion efforts.

High profile attacks include:
- Aurora
- RSA
- APT1
- Stuxnet

### Characteristics
- **Advanced**
  - attackers using a variety of intrusion technologies, possibly custom developed malware.
- **Persistent**
  - determined attack over an extended period of time against the target.
  - attacks continue until target is compromised.
- **Threats**
  - blackmail.
  - 

## Viruses
Piece of software that infects programs.
- modifies them to include a copy of the virus.
- replicates and goes on to infect other content.
- easily spread through network environments.

Can be attacted to a <code>.exe</code>, and do anything that program is permitted to do.
- executes secretly when the host program is run.

Specific to OS and hardware.
- takes advantage of their details & weaknesses.

*Macro viruses* infect scripting code used to support active content in a variety of user document types.

## Virus components
- **Infection mechanism**
  - means by which a virus spreads, also know as *infection vector*.
- **Trigger**
  - condition that determines when the payload is activated/delivered, also known as *logic bomb*.
- **Payload**
  - what the virus does.
  - may involve damage.

### Virus phases
1. Dormant phase.
    - virus is idle, awaiting activation.
2. Triggering phase.
    - virus places a copy of itself into other programs or certain areas on the disk.
3. Propagation phase.
    - virus is activated!
4. Execution phase.
    - function is performed; may be harmless or damaging, such as a message or destruction of programs/files!

| Classification by target | Classification by concealment strategy |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| - Boot sector infector.  | - Encrypted virus.                     |
| - File infector.         | - Stealth virus.                       |
| - Macro virus.           | - Polymorphic virus.                   |
| - Multipartile virus.    | - Metamorphic virus.                   |

## Worms
Programs that actively seek out more machines to infect and each infected machine serves as an automated launching pad for attacks on other machines.

Worms:
- exploit software vulnerabilities.
- can use network connections to spread.
- spread through shared media (USB drives, CD, DVDs etc...).
- spread in email through macro or script code included in attachments.
- usually carry some form of payload.

### Worm replication
- **Email or messenger**
  - worm emails a copy of itself to other systems.
- **File sharing**
  - creates a copy of itself or infects a file as a virus on removable media.
- **Remote execution capability**
  - worm executes a copy of itself on another system.
- **Remote file access or transfer capability**
  - worm uses a remote file access or transfer service to copy itself from one system to another.
- **Remote login capability**
  - worm logs onto a remote system as a user then uses commands to copy itself from on system to the other.
