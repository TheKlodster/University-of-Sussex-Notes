| Advantages                                                                     | Disadvantages

| - Simple.                                                                      | - Bureaucratic: many documents well suited to knocking out small animals.                               
| - Documentation gives external clients reassurances that things are proceeding.| - Inflexible: requirements often change between analysis and deployment.                                  
| - Fairly simple to manage.                                                     | - Long delay before the software is deployed.
| - Easier for everyone to follow.                                               |
### Project Management
--------------------------------------------------
A role where someone ensures that software is delivered on time, on schedule and in accordance with the requirements of the organisations developing and procuring the software. <br>

**Needed** because software development is always subject to budget & schedule constraints that are set by the organisation.

#### Role of a Project Manager :
- **Proposal Preparation**
- **Project Planning**
	- time.
	- resources.
	- motivation.
- **Reporting**
	- keeping the customer informed.
- **Risk Management**
	- reducing the exposure of things going wrong.

#### Success Criteria
- Deliver the software to the customer at the agreed time.
- Keep overall costs within the budget.
- Deliver software that meets the customer's expectations.
- Maintain a happy and well-functioning development team.

#### Managing Software Development
- Product is intangible :
	- software cannot be seen or touched, progress can't just be 'seen'.
- Many projects are 'one-off' projects :
	- large software projects are usually dfferent in some ways from previous projects.
- Sofware processes are variable and **organisation** specific :
	- cannot predict when a particular software is likely to lead to development problems.

### Risk Management
--------------------------------------------------
Risk Management is the process of identifying risks and drawing up plans to minimise their effect on the project. <br>
Risk can impact :
- resources and timescales.
- quality and performance of software.
- organisational stability.

Some examples :
- Staff Turnover
- Management Change
- Requirement Change
- Hardware Unavailability

5 points we need to illustrate risk, **in that order** :
1. **Risk Identification** - what is the risk?
1. **Risk Analysis** - what are the causes of the risk?
1. **Risk Impact** (can occur in anywhere) - the effects of the risk?
1. **Risk Planning** - what do we do it one of these risk factors comes to pass?
1. **Risk Monitoring** - how do we detect whether one has happened, what do we do about it?
